### 🔗 Project Links

### 🛠️ The Challenge
As an IT Engineering student at PCCOE, I conducted this analysis to transform raw retail data into actionable business intelligence. 

### 🐍 Data Engineering (Python)
I used **Python (Pandas)** to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
* **Cleaning:** Handled date formatting and encoding issues.
* **Feature Engineering:** Created a `Profit Margin %` column to evaluate true regional performance.

### 📈 Key Business Insights
* **The Texas Profit Leak:** I identified that while Texas is a top revenue driver ($170k+), it has a significant **-33.6% profit margin**. This indicates that high sales are being offset by excessive discounting or high shipping costs.
* **Seasonal Demand:** Revenue consistently peaks in **Q4 (Nov-Dec)** annually, suggesting a need for increased inventory by September.

### 🚀 Tools Used
* Python (Pandas)
* Tableau Desktop Public Edition
* Microsoft Excel
